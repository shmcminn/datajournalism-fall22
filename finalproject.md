# Final project details

You must complete a final project for this class, either in pairs or -- upon request -- individually. The project has two components:

A reported story pitch based substantially on a dataset, with at least two data visualizations, due by 6 p.m. on Nov 22.

The story should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

The pitch should include (at minimum):

* The steps used to analyze the data
* Findings from the data, including a proposed nut graf
* The data sources
* Plans for how you would report and structure this story if given more time

Additionally, you will produce two data visualizations to include with your story. These can be prepared using any tool, provided they meet the best practices for data visualization we discuss in class. The graphics should be integrated into the piece in a way that enhances the storytelling - not merely added on as decoration. 

The final project is worth 30% of your grade. It will break down as follows:

* 20% for pitch
* 10% for data visualizations

### Examples of ideas from final projects in previous terms:

* How do locations of grocery stores differ in urban and rural communities? 
* How DC metro changes would affect different demographic groups
